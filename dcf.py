'''
The discounted Cashflow models is a method of discounting future cashflows of a business at a considerable rate 
to bring it to today's value. With this formula, one can determine a reasonable intrinsic value of the business they wish to buy
Owners earnings=Cashflow for owners=Operating cashflow-maintenance capEx. If you assume maintenance capEx=total capEx, 
then Owners earnings=FreeCashFlow(FCF)
